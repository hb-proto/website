    <h1 class="title">Welcome to <code>hb.sbs</code>!</h1>

    <p>Hey, thanks for visiting. If you're here from twitter, you're probably wondering what this is about. It's simple, really:</p>

    <h2>What the HECK should I do with this website?</h2>

    <p>I bought this domain quite a while ago while hunting for a short domain name.</p>

    <p>During my search, I saw that a new gTLD was registerable (<code>.sbs</code>) and there were a few short domain names avaliable. I bought my brother <code>kyle.sbs</code> (it was only like $2), and I bought myself <code>hb.sbs</code> (it was like $15). How often do you get to buy a 2-letter domain with a short TLD!?</p>

    <p>A two-letter domain name! I was pretty excited at first. A few days later though, I realized that I had no idea what I'd even use this domain for. My personal website exists under <code>slightknack.dev</code>, and I have a couple of small independent websites for projects I run (e.g. <code>passerine.io</code>), so I'm not exactly in need of a website...</p>

    <p>So without a project in need of a website, I have a website in need of a project!</p>

    <h2>I mean I have some ideas...</h2>

    Well, I have some ideas. I could...

    <ul>
      <li>Use it as a custom link shortener, running something like the null-pointer</li>
      <li>Make a personal OS / search engine / knowledge base thing.</li>
      <li>Start a minimal clone of <code>glitch.me</code>.
        <ul>
          <li>To analogize: <code>hb.sbs</code> would be to <code>glitch.me</code> as <code>riju.codes</code> is to <code>repl.it</code>.</li>
          <li>Anyone could publish simple remixible webapps, editable in browser.</li>
          <li>Maybe backed by a minimal persistent real-time database or something.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I think I'm getting ahead of myself...</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What are YOUR ideas!?</h1>
    <p>Send me your ideas by replying to this tweet:</p>

    <pre><code>HOLD UP, I'M GRABBING THE LINK TO THE TWEET! (just hit the back button for now haha)</code></pre>

    <p>Alternatively, shoot me an email at:</p>

    <pre>
<code>i-have-a-crazy-idea-for@hb.sbs</code>
</pre>

    <p>If you don't want to type that out, <code>ideas@hb.sbs</code> works too.</p>

    <img src="https://c.tenor.com/SfWVh-ll30wAAAAC/what-do.gif">

    <p>After I get a few project ideas, I'll run a poll with the most popular options to see what the best project is.</p>

    <p>Stay tuned!</p>
